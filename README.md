# Food Order App

This app is a practice project for the core concepts of React as well as some more advanced features like: effects, context, reducers and forwardRefs. The demo app simulates the functionality of a shopping cart (adding and removing meals and their quantity, dinamically updating the prices etc.)

This app is bootstraped with create-react-app.
